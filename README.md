# WebOS
Entry for HackIllinois 2021. Joung and Vik make a website that follows the operating system aesthetic. Open and close windows, add apps, etc. All actions are stored in a database so that when you reload the page, your changes are still there!

## To Use
Navigate to the WebOS Directory and run the following commands:  
```cd client  
yarn  
yarn start  
   
cd api   
yarn start
